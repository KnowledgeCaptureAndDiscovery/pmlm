Training a model entails a series of steps that execute algorithms and carry out data preprocessing. To represent these steps, we subclass prov:Activity to create two subclasses: pmlm:DataPreprocessingActivity and pmlm:TrainingActivity.

The DataPreprocessingActivity class indicates that some data preprocessing task was applied on an input dataset to produce an output. The properties for this class include: pmlm:appliedDataPreprocessing with range pmlm:DataPreprocessing, and pmlm:usedInput and pmlm:producedOutput with range pmlm:Data.

The TrainingActivity class indicates that a LearningTask was accomplished on some Data or LabelledDataset, to produce a TrainedModel using a LearningApproach, an Algorithm and a LossFunction. If the Algorithm was a NeuralNetwork then the TrainingActivity also specifies an Optimizer to adjust the weights during training. The properties used for each of those items are respectively: hadLearningTask, usedInput, producedTrainedModel, usedLearningApproach, usedAlgorithm, usedLossFunction, and usedOptimizer.
