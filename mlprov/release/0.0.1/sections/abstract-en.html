<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Our approach is to use a provenance representation as a backbone to capture the activities, resources, and agents that created an ML model. Provenance captures events that occurred in the past, along with any resources that were used or produced as well as the actors who were responsible for the events.

We use the W3C PROV standard as a basis [CITE], in particular the PROV-O ontology which we extend for ML models.

Our work to date focuses on an initial ontology that captures key aspects of how ML models are generated. We note that it can be easily extended to capture additional provenance details as needed, such as the underlying execution resources and other aspects that are known to affect reproducibility.
