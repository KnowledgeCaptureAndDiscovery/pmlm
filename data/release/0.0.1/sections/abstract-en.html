<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
PMLM has a top-level class for representing data: pmlm:Data. pmlm:Data is a subclass of prov:Entity.

pmlm:Data has pre-defined subclasses for different types of data, including TabularData, GraphData, Image, SequentialData, and VolumetricData. SequentialData is then further subclassed into Audio, Video, Text and TimeSeries. The Data subclasses can be easily extended for each domain as needed.
